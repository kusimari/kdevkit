Options (`yolo` is **off** by default): `yolo` — chain phases and skip assumption plans; `yolo off` — revert.

**Before Step 1**, parse the invocation message: extract recognized option tokens and apply them; the rest is the feature name for Step 2.

Work through the steps below **in order**.

---

## Step 1 — Project context

Read `.kdevkit/project.md` from the project root.

- **File has content** → load it silently; note what the project is in your internal context.
- **File is missing or empty** → ask exactly one question:
  *"Briefly describe this project — purpose, tech stack, and any hard constraints."*
  Wait for the answer, then create `.kdevkit/project.md` with a well-structured summary.
  Do not continue to Step 2 until the file exists with real content.

## Step 1.6 — Load dev-loop instructions

Check for `.kdevkit/agent-dev-instructions.md`.

- **File exists** → load it silently. For the rest of this session, apply its Quality Gate, Test Gate,
  and Push Gate whenever completing any unit of implementation work.
- **File missing** → continue normally. After the first implementation task is complete, offer once:
  *"No dev-loop instructions found. Run `agent-dev-loop` to auto-detect your quality and test
  toolchain and generate `.kdevkit/agent-dev-instructions.md`."*
  Do not repeat this offer during the session.

## Step 1.5 — Persist standing rules

Write the kdevkit standing rules into the agent's native configuration file so they survive across sessions without needing to be reloaded manually.

**Identify the running agent** and target the corresponding file:

| Agent | Target file |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |
| OpenAI Codex | `AGENTS.md` |
| Kiro | `.kiro/steering/workflow.md` |

**Idempotency check:** Read the target file (if it exists). If it already contains `<!-- kdevkit:standing-rules -->`, skip this step — the rules are already persisted.

**If absent:** Append the block below to the target file. Do not modify any existing content — only append. For Kiro, create the `.kiro/steering/` directory if it does not exist.

```markdown
<!-- kdevkit:standing-rules -->
## kdevkit Standing Rules

### Git Practices

**Branches:** `<type>/<short-description>` — types: `feat` · `fix` · `chore` · `docs` · `refactor` · `test`

**Commits:** Conventional Commits — `type(scope): subject`; imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period; subject ≤ 72 chars; body explains *why* not *what*; every commit must leave the repo in a working state.

**Scope:** Changes stay local to this project — never modify global git config or write outside the project root.

**Pull Requests:** Title follows `type(scope): subject`; body explains *why* and what approach was chosen; keep PRs small (one concern per PR); squash merge.

**Hygiene:** No commented-out code, debug prints, temporary test files, secrets, or credentials in commits.

### Session Behaviour

**Feature file:** Update `.kdevkit/feature/<name>.md` after each meaningful unit of work — do not batch updates.

**Phase gating:** Never chain phases automatically — stop and wait for explicit instruction between phases.

**Assumptions:** If a phase input is ambiguous, present a brief plan and wait for approval before proceeding.

**YOLO mode:** "yolo" drops phase gates and assumption plans; "yolo off" restores normal behaviour.

**Feature completion:** When the feature is done, offer to update `.kdevkit/project.md` with what changed.
<!-- /kdevkit:standing-rules -->
```

## Step 2 — Feature context

Determine the feature file to load:
- If an argument was passed (`$ARGUMENTS`), derive the path: `.kdevkit/feature/<argument>.md`
  (lowercase the argument and replace spaces with hyphens — e.g. `user auth` → `.kdevkit/feature/user-auth.md`).
- Otherwise, ask: *"Which feature are you working on? Provide a short name."*
  Use the answer the same way: `.kdevkit/feature/<name>.md`.

Then:
- **File has content** → load it silently; note what is currently being built.
- **File is missing or empty** → follow the Feature Setup process below to create it.
  Do not continue to Step 3 until the file exists with real content.

### Feature Setup

When a feature file needs to be created, conduct a structured interview process to establish a clear understanding of the feature's requirements, design, testing strategy, and implementation plan.

#### File Location

Feature files reside in `.kdevkit/feature/` and are named after the feature (e.g., `user-auth` → `.kdevkit/feature/user-auth.md`). Names should be lowercase and hyphenated.

#### Git Setup

Before interviews, determine the user's preferred git setup (branch or worktree) and the base commit. If the current branch already matches the feature name, skip branch/worktree creation. Propose the `git checkout -b <feature-name> <commit-ish>` or `git worktree add <feature-name> -b <feature-name> <commit-ish>` command for user confirmation.

#### Interview Process

Use existing project context to inform the interview process and avoid starting from scratch. Run four interviews to define the feature:
1. **Requirements:** Understand the problem, user interaction, and success criteria.
2. **Design:** Define the technical approach, architecture, and component interactions.
3. **Testing:** Define the validation strategy, including test types and key scenarios.
4. **Implementation:** Plan the development approach, task breakdown, and risk mitigation.

#### Output Format

After completing interviews, create the feature file at `.kdevkit/feature/<feature-name>.md` using the template below. This file serves as both a decision record and agent instructions for the rest of the session.

```markdown
# Feature: <name>

## Git Setup
- Branch: <branch-name>
- Base: <commit-ish or branch>

## Feature Brief
<one paragraph — what this feature is and why it is being built>

## Requirements
<bullet list from the requirements interview>

## Design
<technical approach, key components, and how they interact>

## Test Strategy
<validation approach, test types, and key scenarios>

## Implementation Plan
<ordered task list with risk notes>

## Session Log
<!-- append entries as work progresses: date · what was done · decisions made -->

## Decision Log
<!-- append entries for any significant choice: decision · rationale · alternatives rejected -->
```

---

## Step 3 — Git practices

Apply these git conventions for the full duration of this session:

### Branches

Pattern: `<type>/<short-description>`

Types: `feat` · `fix` · `chore` · `docs` · `refactor` · `test`

Examples:
- `feat/user-auth`
- `fix/null-pointer-on-login`
- `chore/update-deps`

### Commits

Format: Conventional Commits — `type(scope): subject`

Rules:
- Imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period
- Subject line ≤ 72 characters
- Each commit must leave the repo in a working state — no broken builds mid-branch
- If a commit needs a body, the body explains *why*, not *what* (the diff shows what)

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation`
- `fix(api): handle empty response from upstream`
- `chore: bump Node to 22`

### Scope

- Commits and config changes stay **local to this project** — never modify global git config
- Do not write to `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.ssh/`, or any path outside the project root
- If a git hook or script tries to write outside the project, flag it before running

### Pull Requests

- PR title follows the same `type(scope): subject` format
- PR body: explain *why* the change is needed and what approach was chosen
- Keep PRs small; one concern per PR
- Squash merge; the squash commit message must match the PR title format

### Commit discipline

- **Commits are save points** — commit whenever a coherent unit of work is done; do not wait until the whole feature is complete
- Every commit must leave the repo in a working state (tests pass, build succeeds)
- Push to the feature branch freely; pushing is not the same as opening a PR

### PR gate

A PR is ready when, and only when, the project's build-and-test command passes locally. Do not open a PR if the build is broken or tests are red.

### Hygiene

- Do not commit commented-out code, debug prints, or temporary test files
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or environment-specific values
- If `.gitignore` needs updating, include it in the same commit that adds the ignored file

---

## Step 4 — Session behaviour (always active)

Apply these rules throughout the entire session without needing to be reminded:

**Keep the feature file current.** After each meaningful unit of work — a decision made, a subtask completed, an open question resolved — update the feature file to reflect the current state. Do not batch updates to the end of the session.

**Phase gating.** Never chain phases automatically. After completing any phase (requirements, design, implementation, tests, or any other), stop and wait for explicit instruction before starting the next. The order of phases is flexible — the gate applies between any two phases regardless of sequence.

**Assumptions within a phase.** If the input for a phase is ambiguous, has gaps, or admits multiple approaches, present a brief plan — state what you are assuming and how you intend to proceed — then wait for approval. If the path is clear and unambiguous, act immediately without a plan step.

**Efficient file loading.** Use the project context, feature context, and your own memory to understand the task. Avoid reading files if the context you have is sufficient. Load companion files only when they are needed for the current task.

**YOLO mode.** When the user says "yolo", enable YOLO mode for the rest of the session:
- Drop the phase gate: chain phases automatically without stopping between them
- Drop the plan step: act on assumptions without presenting them first

When the user says "yolo off", return to normal gated behaviour immediately.

**Feature completion.** When the user indicates that the feature is done, finished, or complete:
1. Prompt: *"Before we close out — shall I update `.kdevkit/project.md` with what changed? This keeps future sessions oriented."*
2. If yes: summarise what was built, key decisions made, and any new constraints or patterns introduced, then update `.kdevkit/project.md` accordingly.
3. If no: acknowledge and move on.

## Step 5 — Confirm

Reply with a compact summary:

```
Project:  <one sentence from .kdevkit/project.md>
Feature:  <one sentence from the feature file> [<path to feature file>]
Practices: git loaded
Mode:     normal  (or: YOLO if yolo is active)
```

Then stop and wait for the first instruction.
